  - type: noting
    date_effective: 1991-10-03
    message: noting that the accuracy of clock comparisons has been greatly improved
      by the use of satellite techniques,
  actions:
  - type: affirms / reaffirming
    date_effective: 1991-10-03
    message: |-
      remarks that this accuracy

       can be further improved by the better use of the satellite techniques already developed,
       reveals the differences and systematic variations among atomic frequency standards,
       allows a better synchronization of national time scales,

      recommends

       the construction of new primary caesium standards, the improvement of the frequency accuracy of existing primary standards and the study of the systematic differences in frequency which exist between them,
       that the laboratories participating in International Atomic Time (TAI) stabilize the environmental conditions of each contributing clock, keep careful records of these environmental conditions and report them to the BIPM,
       that the coordinates adopted for antennas used in single-way time comparison by satellite techniques correspond to their real position in the terrestrial reference system of the International Earth Rotation Service.

  subject: The Josephson and quantum-Hall effects
  identifier: 2
  approvals:
  - type: affirmative
    degree: unanimous
    message: The 19th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures,
  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: 1991-10-03
    message: |-
      considering

       that worldwide uniformity and long-term stability of the national representations of electrical units are of great importance for science, industry and commerce for both technical and economic reasons,
       that many national laboratories now use the Josephson and quantum-Hall effects for the conservation of their representations of the volt and the ohm respectively, a practice giving complete security in terms of long-term stability,
       that the values attributed to their representations should be in as close as possible agreement with the SI,

    date_effective: 1991-10-03
    message: recalling link:/en/CGPM/db/18/6/[Resolution 6 of the 18th Conférence
      Générale] concerning adjustments then foreseen in representations of the volt
      and the ohm,
  - type: noting
    date_effective: 1991-10-03
    message: noting the decisions made by the Comité International des Poids et Mesures
      in 1988, during its 77th Meeting concerning these adjustments, in particular
      the conventional values _K_~J-90~ (equal to 483 597,9 GHz/V) and _R_~K-90~ (equal
      to 25 812,807 image::/utils/special/14/omega_maj.gif[capital omega]) attributed
      to the Josephson constant _K_~J~ and the von Klitzing constant _R_~K~ used in
      representations of the volt and the ohm respectively,

      recommends

       that national laboratories continue their efforts to reduce the uncertainty in the knowledge of the ratios _K_~J-90~/_K_~J~ and _R_~K-90~/_R_~K~,
       that research be continued into the basic theory of the Josephson and quantum-Hall effects.

  considerations:
  - type: considering
    date_effective: 1991-10-03
    message: |-
      considering

       that worldwide uniformity and long-term stability in the measurement of temperature are of great importance for science, industry and commerce for both technical and economic reasons,
       that the international temperature scale should be as close as possible to thermodynamic temperature,
  - type: noting

    message: |-
      noting

       that the link:/en/CGPM/db/18/7/[18th Conférence Générale in its Resolution 7] had invited the Comité International des Poids et Mesures and national laboratories to prepare and adopt a new international scale to replace the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968, by then known to differ significantly from thermodynamic temperatures,
       that the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) adopted by the Comité International in 1989 at its 78th Meeting is generally more precise, more readily realized and more nearly in accord with thermodynamic temperatures, and that it fulfills the requirements demanded of it by Resolution 7 of the 18th Conférence Générale,
  actions:
  - type: recommends
    date_effective: 1991-10-03
    message: recommends that national laboratories continue their efforts to improve
      the worldwide uniformity and long-term stability in the measurement of temperature
      by the rapid implementation of the ITS-90 and the maintenance of research programmes
      on fundamental thermometry.
