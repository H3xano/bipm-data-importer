    message: "*considering*\n\n* that the present definition does not allow a sufficiently
      precise realization of the metre for all requirements,\n* that progress made
      in the stabilization of lasers allows radiations to be obtained that are more
      reproducible and easier to use than the standard radiation emitted by a krypton
      86 lamp,\n* that progress made in the measurement of the frequency and wavelength
      of these radiations has resulted in concordant determinations of the speed of
      light whose accuracy is limited principally by the realization of the present
      definition of the metre,\n* that wavelengths determined from frequency measurements
      and a given value for the speed of light have a reproducibility superior to
      that which can be obtained by comparison with the wavelength of the standard
      radiation of krypton 86,\n* that there is an advantage, notably for astronomy
      and geodesy, in maintaining unchanged the value of the speed of light recommended
      in 1975 by the link:/en/CGPM/db/15/2/[15th CGPM in its Resolution 2] (_c_ =
      299 792 458 m/s),\n* that a new definition of the metre has been envisaged in
      various forms all of which have the effect of giving the speed of light an exact
      value, equal to the recommended value, and that this introduces no appreciable
      discontinuity into the unit of length, taking into account the relative uncertainty
      of image::/utils/special/Math/plusminus.gif[] 4 ´ 10^\x969^ of the best realizations
      of the present definition of the metre,\n* that these various forms, making
      reference either to the path travelled by light in a specified time interval
      or to the wavelength of a radiation of measured or specified frequency, have
      been the object of consultations and deep discussions, have been recognized
      as being equivalent and that a consensus has emerged in favour of the first
      form,\n* that the Comité Consultatif pour la Définition du Mètre (CCDM) is now
      in a position to give instructions for the practical realization of such a definition,
      instructions which could include the use of the orange radiation of krypton
      86 used as standard up to now, and which may in due course be extended or revised,"

      . The metre is the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.
      . The definition of the metre in force since 1960, based upon the transition between the levels 2p~10~ and 5d~5~ of the atom of krypton 86, is abrogated.

      *invites* the Comité International des Poids et Mesures

      * to draw up instructions for the practical realization of the new definition of the metre,
      * to choose radiations which can be recommended as standards of wavelength for the interferometric measurement of length and to draw up instructions for their use,
      * to pursue studies undertaken to improve these standards.

      recalling link:/en/CGPM/db/16/1/[Resolution 1 of the 16th General Conference on Weights and Measures (1979)] dealing with the measurement of mass

      and *considering*

      * that the air-buoyancy correction is based upon the density of the ambient air,
      * that one can improve the uniformity and the accuracy of mass measurements by encouraging laboratories, when they have to calculate the density of air starting from the ambient conditions, to use for this calculation a unique equation known to all and recognized as sufficiently accurate,

      invites the Comité International des Poids et Mesures

      * to draw up and recommend such an equation,
      * to pursue and coordinate the studies undertaken or to undertake to improve the experimental determination of the density of air and of the correction due to air-buoyancy,
      * to bring up to date the recommended equation when better experimental determinations permit.

      * the importance of the work carried out by the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) and of the services that it renders to all countries,
      * the necessity of providing the BIPM with a minimum of resources which will not endanger the pursuit of these activities and
      * the difficulty of foreseeing, in the present economic circumstances, the minimum financial resources needed to permit the BIPM to fulfil its mission as the world centre for scientific metrology,
