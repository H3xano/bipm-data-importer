    message: "*Appendix 3. The base units of the SI*\n\nStarting from the new definition
      of the SI described above in terms of fixed numerical values of the defining
      constants, definitions of each of the seven base units are deduced by taking,
      as appropriate, one or more of these defining constants to give the following
      set of definitions, effective from 20 May 2019:\n\n* The second, symbol s, is
      the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the
      caesium frequency image::/utils/special/14/delta_maj.gif[capital Delta]image::/utils/special/14/ital/nu.gif[nu]~Cs~,
      the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133
      atom, to be 9 192 631 770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s^\x961^.\n*
      The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed
      numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum _c_ to be 299 792 458 when expressed
      in the unit m/s, where the second is defined in terms of image::/utils/special/14/delta_maj.gif[capital
      Delta]image::/utils/special/14/ital/nu.gif[nu]~Cs~.\n* The kilogram, symbol
      kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value
      of the Planck constant _h_ to be 6.626 070 15 × 10^\x9634^ when expressed in
      the unit J s, which is equal to kg m^2^ s^\x961^, where the metre and the second
      are defined in terms of _c_ and image::/utils/special/14/delta_maj.gif[capital
      Delta]image::/utils/special/14/ital/nu.gif[nu]~Cs~.\n* The ampere, symbol A,
      is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical
      value of the elementary charge _e_ to be 1.602 176 634 × 10^\x9619^ when expressed
      in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms of
      image::/utils/special/14/delta_maj.gif[capital Delta]image::/utils/special/14/ital/nu.gif[nu]~Cs~.\n*
      The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is defined
      by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant _k_ to be 1.380
      649 × 10^\x9623^ when expressed in the unit J K^\x961^, which is equal to kg
      m^2^ s^\x962^ K^\x961^, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in
      terms of _h_, _c_ and image::/utils/special/14/delta_maj.gif[capital Delta]image::/utils/special/14/ital/nu.gif[nu]~Cs~.\n*
      The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains
      exactly 6.022 140 76 × 10^23^ elementary entities. This number is the fixed
      numerical value of the Avogadro constant, _N_~A~, when expressed in the unit
      mol^\x961^ and is called the Avogadro number. +\nThe amount of substance, symbol
      _n_, of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities.
      An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other
      particle or specified group of particles.\n* The candela, symbol cd, is the
      SI unit of luminous intensity in a given direction. It is defined by taking
      the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation
      of frequency 540 × 10^12^ Hz, K~cd~, to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm
      W^\x961^, which is equal to cd sr W^\x961^, or cd sr kg^\x961^ m^\x962^ s^3^,
      where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of _h_, _c_ and image::/utils/special/14/delta_maj.gif[capital
