    message: considering that the units radian and steradian are usually introduced
      into expressions for units when there is need for clarification, especially
      in photometry where the steradian plays an important role in distinguishing
      between units corresponding to different quantities,

    message: considering that in the equations used one generally expresses plane
      angle as the ratio of two lengths and solid angle as the ratio between an area
      and the square of a length, and consequently that these quantities are treated
      as dimensionless quantities,

    message: considering that the study of the formalisms in use in the scientific

       that the interpretation given by the CIPM in 1969 for the class of supplementary units introduced in cgpm-resolution:en/11/12[Resolution 12] of the 11th Conférence Générale des Poids et mesures (CGPM) in 1960 allows the freedom of treating the radian and the steradian as SI base units,
       that such a possibility compromises the internal coherence of the SI based on only seven base units,
