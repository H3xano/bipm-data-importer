    7 of the 18th Conférence Générale des Poids et Mesures (1987) has adopted the
    International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) to supersede the International
    Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68).\nThe CIPM notes that, by comparison
    with the IPTS-68, the ITS-90\n\nextends to lower temperatures, down to 0.65 K,
    and hence also supersedes the EPT-76,\nis in substantially better agreement with
    corresponding thermodynamic temperatures,\nhas much improved continuity, precision
    and reproducibility throughout its range and\nhas subranges and alternative definitions
    in certain ranges which greatly facilitate its use.\n\nThe CIPM also notes that,
    to accompany the text of the ITS-90 there will be two further documents, the Supplementary
    Information for the ITS-90 and Techniques for Approximating the ITS-90. These
    documents will be published by the BIPM and periodically updated.\nThe CIPM recommends\n\nthat
    on 1 January 1990 the ITS-90 come into force and\nthat from this same date the
    IPTS-68 and the EPT-76 be abrogated.\n\n\n\t        \n\n                \n                \n
