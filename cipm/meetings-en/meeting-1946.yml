  x-unparsed:
  - Joule (unit of energy or work) - The joule is the work done when the point of
    application of 1 MKS unit of force [newton] moves a distance of 1 metre in the
    direction of the force.
  - |-
    Watt (unit of power) - The watt is the power which in one second gives rise to energy of 1 joule.
    (B) Definitions of electric units. The Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CIPM) accepts the following propositions which define the theoretical value of the electric units:
  - |-
    Ampere (unit of electric current) - The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross-section, and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 ´
     10-7 MKS unit of force [newton] per metre of length.
  - Volt (unit of potential difference and of electromotive force) - The volt is the
    potential difference between two points of a conducting wire carrying a constant
    current of 1 ampere, when the power dissipated between these points is equal to
    1 watt.
  - Ohm (unit of electric resistance) - The ohm is the electric resistance between
    two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of 1 volt, applied
    to these points, produces in the conductor a current of 1 ampere, the conductor
    not being the seat of any electromotive force.
  - Coulomb (unit of quantity of electricity) - The coulomb is the quantity of electricity
    carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere.
  - Farad (unit of capacitance) - The farad is the capacitance of a capacitor between
    the plates of which there appears a potential difference of 1 volt when it is
    charged by a quantity of electricity of 1 coulomb.
  - Henry (unit of electric inductance) - The henry is the inductance of a closed
    circuit in which an electromotive force of 1 volt is produced when the electric
    current in the circuit varies uniformly at the rate of 1 ampere per second.
  - "Weber (unit of magnetic flux) - The weber is the magnetic flux which, linking
    a circuit of one turn, would produce in it an electromotive force of 1 volt if
    it were reduced to zero at a uniform rate in 1 second.\n\n\n\t        \n                \n
